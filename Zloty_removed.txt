z oty (golden) a traditional Polish unit dating back Middle Ages. Initially, in 14th 15th centuries, name was used for all kinds of foreign gold coins used in Poland, most notably Venetian Hungarian ducats. In 1496 Sejm approved creation of a national currency, z oty, its value was set at 30 groszy, a coin minted since 1347 modelled on Prague groschen. grosz was subdivided in2 p grosz or 3 solidi.
name z oty (sometimes referred as florin) was used for a number of different coins, including 30 groszy coin called polski z oty, czerwony z oty (Red z oty) z oty re ski (Rhine guilder), which were in circulation at time. However, value of Polish z oty dropped over time relative these foreign coins it became a silver coin, with foreign ducats eventually circulating at approximately 5 z otych.
Following monetary reform carried out by King Stanaw August Poniatowski, z oty became Poland's official exchange rate of 1 z oty 30 groszy was confirmed. Until 1787, z oty was tied Conventionsthaler of Holy Roman Empire, with 8 z oty equal one Conventionsthaler and, consequently, 4 groschen equal z oty. Two debasements of occurred in years before final partition of Poland.



z oty remained in circulation after Partitions of PolDuchy of Warsaw issued coins denominated in grosz, z oty talar (plurals talary talar w), worth 6 z oty. Talar banknotes were also issued.



From 1816, z oty was issued by Russian-controlled Congress Poland, with a fixed exchange rate between Polish Russian currencies of 1 kopeck = 2 grosze, or 15 kopeck = 1 z oty. Warsaw mint issued grosz z oty until 1832, when it began issue coins denominated in both Polish Russian currencies. From 1842, Warsaw mint issued regular type Russian coins along with some coins denominated in both grosz kopeck. In 1850, last coins bearing Polish denominations were minted. Between 1835 1846, Free City of Krak w also issued a currency, Krak w z oty




From 1850, only issued for use in Congress Polwas rubel consisting of Russian notes of Bank Polski. monetary system of Congress Polwas unified with Russian Empire following failed January Uprising in 1863. However, gold coins remained in use until early 20th century, much like other gold coins of epoch, most notably gold roubles (dubbed  winka, or piggy) sovereigns. Following occupation of Congress Polby Germans during World War I in 1917, rubel was replaced by marka (plurals marki marek), a initially equivalent German Papiermark.






z oty was reintroduced as Poland's by W adys aw Grabski in 1924, following hyperinflation monetary chaos of years after World War I. It replaced marka at a rate of 1 z oty = 1,800,000 marek was subdivided in100 groszy. z oty was pegged at 0.1687 grams pure gold. 1 1939-z oty = 8 2004-z oty.

Between 1950 1990, a unit known as z oty dewizowy (which can be roughly translated as foreign exchange z oty) was used as an artificial for calculation purposes only. It existed because at time z oty was not convertible its official rate of exchange was set by Government, there existed several exchange rates depending on purpose of transaction who was exchanging, i.e. a given amount in z oty could be exchanged for say US dollars at one of several official exchange rates depending on what was be bought for hard company that was buying foreign exchange; it worked similarly when a company had some earnings in Western wanted (or needed) convert them inz otych. exchange rate did not depend on amount being converted. Visitors from countries outside of Soviet Bloc were offered a particularly poor exchange rate. Concurrently, private black-market exchange rate contrasted sharply with official government exchange rate until end of Communist rule in 1989 when official rates were tied market rates.

Conditions of Poland's joining European Union (in May 2004) oblige country eventually adopt euro, though not at any specific date only after Polmeets necessary stability criteria. Serious discussions of joining Eurozone have ensued. However, article 227 of Constitution of Republic of Polwill need be amended first, so it seems unlikely that Polwill adopt euro before 2019. Public opinion research by CBOS from March 2011 shows that 60% of Poles are against changing their currency. Only 32% of Poles want adopt euro, compared 41% in April 2010.
